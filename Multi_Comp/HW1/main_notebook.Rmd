This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


Question 1
----------

Part A
======

1.


$H_0:\mu=0 C = \frac{\bar{x}- {\mu}_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} $

Given the question definitions:

```{r}
mu <- 0
sd <- 2
n <- 16
v <- rnorm(n, mu, sd)
v_mean <-mean(v)

C = (v_mean-mu)/(sd/sqrt(n))
p_value <- pnorm(C,mu,sd)
1-p_value
```



```{r}
mu <- 0
sd <- 2
n <- 16
iterations <- 5000

# Simulate 5000 tests, each with 16 samples.
means <- rnorm(iterations, mu, sd/n)

# Calculate the z-score for each simulation
Z = (means-mu)/(sd/sqrt(n))

p_value <- pnorm(Z,mu,sd)
p_value <- 1 - p_value
hist(p_value)
```

2.

In our opinion, $p_{value}\sim Normal(0.5,???)$
